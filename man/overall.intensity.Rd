\usage{
overall.intensity(
  graph_name,
  DV,
  first_group,
  second_group,
  n_per_group,
  data = x
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph_name}{The title of the output barplot.}

\item{DV}{The dependent variable used for the analysis. Should denote the cell type, tissue type or region, and/or wavelength analyzed.}

\item{first_group}{How one of your groups is codified. Note: When imaging tissue for processing, this string must be put at the beginning of the saved filenames.}

\item{second_group}{How the other group is codified. Note: "first_group" and "second_group" must be alphabetized in the respective order of your codified group names.}

\item{n_per_group}{How many subjects are included in each group. Used to compute standard error of the mean for error bars on barplot.}

\item{x}{The name of your .CSV file.}
}
\value{
The analysis table for a two-sample T-Test comparing the groups, as well as a rudimentary barplot.
}
\description{
Processes .CSV files output by the "cell outline" batch macro in the ImageJ custom macros plugin (Timothy and Forlano, 2019).

"Intensity" data refers to the average of the ImageJ "mean grey value" for all above-threshold cells on a particular image, marked by a particular wavelength.

Can only be used to analyze one wavelength per analysis. This R function identifies two groups, produces graphs, and runs an unpaired-samples T-Test.

It is generally recommended that images are taken and analyzed from multiple coronal planes of brain tissue. This particular function averages across the anterior, middle, and posterior planes.

All parameters must be in quotations, besides "n_per_group." The .CSV files to be analyzed must be placed in your working directory.

When imaging your tissue initially, it is critical that the output filenames are saved in the following format: GroupName_ExperimentName_SubjectNumber_MagnificationX_CoronalPlane_LateralSideOfTissue_RegionOfTissue

To mitigate experimenter bias (throughout all stages of the experimental process, but including this one) it is recommended that the group names are codified in a way agnostic to experimental treatment.
